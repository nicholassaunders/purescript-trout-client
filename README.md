# Trout Client

_Automatically derived XHR clients for Trout routing types._

## Usage

```bash
bower install --save purescript-trout-client
```

## Example

The example shows the integration of client and server based on a common
[Trout](https://github.com/owickstrom/purescript-trout) routing type for an
API. AJAX clients are generated by this package for all endpoints, and the
client-side application can safely request resources without having to
duplicate routing information and JSON encoding and decoding instances.

```bash
bower install
(cd example && npm install)
make run-example
```
