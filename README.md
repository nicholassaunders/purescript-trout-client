# Trout Client

_Automatically derived XHR clients for Trout routing types._

## Usage

```bash
bower install --save purescript-trout-client
```

## Examples

### [Client/Server](example/client-server/src)

This example shows the integration of client and server based on a common
[Trout](https://github.com/purescript-hyper/purescript-trout) routing type for
an API. AJAX clients are generated by this package for all endpoints, and the
client-side application can safely request resources without having to
duplicate routing information and JSON encoding and decoding instances.

```bash
make client-server-example
```

### [Client Only](example/client/src)

This example demonstrates how AJAX clients can be derived from a
[Trout](https://github.com/purescript-hyper/purescript-trout) routing type that
models a foreign API.

```bash
make client-example
```
